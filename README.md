# ArcNotify

Utilising existing existing code (https://github.com/kfdm/gntp) based around the GNTP protocol. This enables ArcSight ESM/Logger to send notifications as a rule action to single or multiple GNTP clients.

The advantage of this method for notifications -
* Visual/audio notification and customisable
* Most GNTP clients include notification history
* Won't fill up your mailbox like email notifications
* Very easy to implement
